# Iris Dataset Exploration, Visualization, and Classification

This project demonstrates how to explore, visualize, and classify the famous Iris dataset using Python and libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The project includes steps for data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have installed the following Python packages:

- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Project Structure
The project is organized in a Jupyter Notebook, which guides you through the following steps:

Importing Libraries: Import the necessary libraries for data exploration, visualization, and classification.
Loading the Dataset: Load the Iris dataset and convert it to a pandas DataFrame.
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset's basic properties, such as summary statistics and missing values.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to gain insights into the dataset, including pair plots, correlation heatmaps, box plots, and scatter plots.
Model Building: Train a Random Forest classification model using the scikit-learn library.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Feature Importance: Visualize the importance of each feature in the Random Forest classifier.
Prediction: Create a function to predict the species of an Iris flower using the trained model.


## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
